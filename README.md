Quick Checklist: 10 Rules of Thumb for Selecting a Stock
These rules of thumb are explained more fully in a section below.

The 52 Week Range: Make sure the stock is trading closer to the 52 week low than the high and also has upward momentum.
Volume: Average volume should be around 50,000.
Price/Earnings Ratio: The PE ratio should be somewhere between 1.0x and 10.0x.
EPS and CPS: Earnings and cash flow per share should both be positive with positive growth over each quarter.
Market Cap: There is no specific market cap to look for, just be aware of the risk/reward trade off of each size and their stability as well. (Personally, all of my highest returns have come from mid caps.)
Beta (Volatility): Beta is much like the market cap, in that there is no specific beta to look for. It just depends on risk tolerance. However, if you have a longer time horizon to invest, I would recommend a higher beta and vice versa.
Dividends: Look for stocks that offer dividends. Dividends are usually, but not always, a sign of good financial health.
Open Interest on Options Chains: Look at the open interest on options chains for a specific stock to see how many people are planning on buying and selling and at what price. This basically serves as an opinion poll on the stock’s expected performance.
Insider Activity: Always consider the amount of shares CEOs and other executives are buying and selling, to get an accurate picture of what is happening on the inside.
News: It may be a good idea to avoid stocks that are constantly in the news. Stock prices will often reflect the investors’ recent perception of the stock, which is usually not an accurate evaluation of the underlying, long-term value of the company. The dot-com bubble of the '90s is a perfect example.
